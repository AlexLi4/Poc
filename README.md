My first project is under Gemini Health which is a healthcare company that delivers medical solutions for better price. This project is to update the current client side booking system for better alternative recommendations based on customer’s preference also easy for developers to maintain the system in the future, The system is mainly built in microservices architecture using spring boot and spring cloud. I used Eureka to register services and Zuul proxy to routes traffic in the microservices. I created database using mySql and SpringData JPA and Hibernate to cooperate with database to get the details of customer’s medical options and so on. For user authentication and authorization, I implemented SSO(Single sign on) using spring security and JWT(json web token) to enable customers to login their account in easier way. For the message broker, I used Apache Kafka to ensure to handle the high throughput of data transmission as well as reduce load latency. To utilize the User interface, I used angular, ajax to generate a single paged HTML view to show the information of their medical plans. I also used Bootstrap to bueatify the front end pages and make it more user friendly. I deployed the application on AWS C2 instances with Docker container. I also used git as version control tools and performed unit testing using JUnit and Postman to test my restful apis.
